In this course, we\r\nexplore the literature on digital history, and then put theory into practice by\r\ndigitally collecting, evaluating, and producing historical knowledge. Along with\r\ndiscussing what is digital history and how it is evolving, this course will\r\nintroduce students to text mining, geographic information systems (GIS) and\r\ndeveloping historical websites. We will also explore how digital archives are changing how we\r\npreserve and research history. Students will get hands-on experience with a wide\r\nrange of digital skills and use these new methods to develop a final digital\r\nhistory project.\r\n\r\nCourse Goals and Learning Outcomes  \r\n====================================\r\n\r\nWe have three goals for this course:\r\n\r\n1.  The development of a digital portfolio, which showcases your work with\r\n    several digital platforms, tools, and languages (including Wordpress, Omeka,\r\n    SketchUp, basic GIS, and basic Python).\r\n\r\n2.
